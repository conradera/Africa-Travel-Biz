# Performance Optimization Notes

## ✅ Warning Fixed

**Issue:** "Resource was preloaded but not used within a few seconds"

**Cause:** Scripts with `defer` attribute were being preloaded, creating a timing conflict.

**Solution:** Removed preload tags for scripts with defer attribute.

## Why This Happened

When you preload a script with `<link rel="preload" href="script.js" as="script">`, you're telling the browser to fetch it early.

But when that same script has `defer`, it won't execute until after HTML parsing is complete.

This creates a mismatch:
1. Browser preloads the script (fetches early)
2. Script has `defer` (delays execution)
3. Warning appears because script "wasn't used" immediately

## The Fix

**Removed preload for:**
- ❌ `script.js` (uses defer)
- ❌ `translations.js` (uses defer)

**Kept preload for:**
- ✅ `styles.css` (critical for rendering)
- ✅ Font Awesome CSS (external resource)

## Best Practice

**Rule:** Only preload resources that execute early.

- ✅ **CSS** - Preload (needed for initial render)
- ✅ **Critical fonts** - Preload
- ❌ **Deferred scripts** - Don't preload (defer already handles loading)
- ✅ **Important images above fold** - Preload
- ❌ **Images below fold** - Use lazy loading instead

## Current Status

✅ No more warnings  
✅ Optimal loading performance  
✅ Scripts load efficiently with defer  
✅ CSS loads early with preload
