## 🚀 Want Direct Sending? (Optional Upgrade)

If you want emails to send **automatically** without opening email client:

### **Setup EmailJS (10 minutes):**

1. **Sign up:** https://www.emailjs.com (free)
2. **Add email service** (Gmail/Outlook)
3. **Create template**
4. **Get credentials** (Public Key, Service ID, Template ID)

5. **Update `script.js` line 160-161:**
   ```javascript
   const serviceId = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_SERVICE_ID';
   const templateId = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_TEMPLATE_ID';
   ```

6. **Add to `index.html` before closing `</head>`:**
   ```html
   <script>
       emailjs.init('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');
   </script>
   ```

### **Benefits of EmailJS:**
